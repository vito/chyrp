### Contribute to the core

Chyrp is developed using a community approach and we encourage participation. If you are interested in
contributing please take a second to read our [Coding Style](STYLE). Any contributions that do not meet these guidelines will not be accepted. Otherwise:
fork, commit &amp; make pull-request. If you don't know how: [http://help.github.com/forking/]

### Git the Source

Another method of grabbing Chyrp and staying up to date with its development, is to use our Git repository. 
            To do this you must have Git installed.

* Initial clone:
            <pre><code>git clone git://github.com/chyrp/chyrp.git</code></pre>
* Stay updated:
            <pre><code>git pull # and then run upgrade.php</code></pre>

### Contribute a module/feather/theme

Do you have something that might be of interest to other Chyrp users? Create a [module](https://github.com/chyrp/chyrp/wiki/Anatomy-of-a-Module) maybe?


If it's properly coded, and it complies with our [Coding Style](STYLE), you can add it to the Extend section, we can publish it on this page and maybe even bundle it with Chyrp future releases if it adds benefit for Chyrp users.
