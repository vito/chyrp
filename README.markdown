Chyrp is a blogging engine designed to be lightweight while retaining functionality. It is driven by PHP and MySQL (or SQLite), and has a great standard theme and robust module engine. You can personalize and modify it any way you want.

All of your content is powered by a unique Feathers system that allows Chyrp to be whatever you want it to be. You can post anything and everything, or just stick to the default Text feather and run a regular blog. Chyrp destroys the fine line between a blog and a tumblelog.

Requirements
============
Chyrp will thrive on virtually any server setup, but we guarantee Chyrp to run on no less than:

* PHP 5 >= 5.2.0
* MySQL:
  - MySQL 4.1+
* SQLite:
  - SQLite 3+
  - PDO

These requirements are more of guidelines, as these are the earliest versions of the services that we have tested Chyrp on. If you are successfully running Chyrp on an earlier version of these services, let us know.

Installation
============
Installing Chyrp is easier than you expect. You can do it in four steps:

1. If using MySQL, create a MySQL database with a username and password.
2. Download, unzip, and upload.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to where you uploaded Chyrp.
4. Follow through the installer at [index.php]().

That's it! Chyrp will be up and running and ready for you to use.

Upgrading
=========
Keeping Chyrp up to date is important to make sure that your blog is as safe and as awesome as possible.

1. Download the latest version of Chyrp from [http://chyrp.net/](http://chyrp.net/).
2. Copy your config files<sup>1</sup> to somewhere safe.
3. Disable any Modules/Feathers that you downloaded for the release you're upgrading from.
4. Overwrite your current Chyrp installation files with the new ones.
5. Restore your config files<sup>1</sup> back to /includes/.
6. Upgrade by navigating to [upgrade.php](), and restore any backups.
7. Re-enable your Modules/Feathers.
8. Run the upgrader again. It will run the Module/Feather upgrade tasks.

<sup>1</sup> The config files vary depending on what you're upgrading from. Any of these in are considered "config files":

* `/includes/config.yaml.php`
* `/includes/database.yaml.php`
* `/includes/config.yml.php`
* `/includes/database.yml.php`
* `/includes/config.php`
* `/includes/database.php`

Extensions
==========
Chyrp isn't complete without activating a few extensions. Extensions add functionality (ex. audio clips, video, photos) to Chyrp. You can find extensions for Chyrp made by the Chyrp community at [http://chyrp.net/extend](http://chyrp.net/extend).

Installing Extensions
=====================
To install extensions, you have to determine what type of extension it is. It can be a *module*, a *feather*, a *theme*, or a *localization*. There's a different setup process for each type.

## Feathers
Feathers add new *post types* to Chyrp. Post types determine what kind of media you can display in your blog.

1. Download and unzip the feather
2. Upload the feather to the `feathers/` folder.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to your Chyrp administration panel.
4. Click on the *Extend* tab, and then the *Feathers* sub tab.
5. Drag it from the Disabled pane to the Enabled pane.

You can now use the feather by navigating to the Write tab and choosing the feather you uploaded.

## Modules
Installing modules is quick, easy, and painless with Chyrp. They add extra functionality to Chyrp.

1. Download and unzip the module.
2. Upload the module to the `modules/` folder.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to your Chyrp administration panel.
4. Click on the *Extend* tab and drag it from the Disabled pane to the Enabled pane.

The module is now installed and is ready for action. Keep in mind that some modules may conflict with each other if they do similar tasks. They are marked with red lines between them on the Modules page.

## Themes
Chyrp makes applying themes to your blog easy. With a single click you can change the look of your blog.

1. Download and unzip the theme.
2. Upload the theme to the `themes/` folder. Make sure that it is contained in it's own folder.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to your Chyrp administration panel.
4. Click on the *Extend* tab, and then the *Themes* sub tab.
5. Click on the screenshot of the theme you just uploaded to apply it to your blog.

Chyrp can even show you what the theme will look like before anyone else sees it. In the Themes sub tab, click on the Preview button below the theme screenshot to see the theme.

## Localization
Chyrp is multilingual! If your first language isn't English, you can apply a new localization to Chyrp to make it speak your language.

1. Download and unzip the localization.
1. Upload the `.mo` file to the `includes/locale/` folder. You don't need anything else for the translation to work.
1. Open your web browser and navigate to your Chyrp administration panel.
1. Click on the *Settings* tab, and change the *Language* option to the language you just uploaded.
